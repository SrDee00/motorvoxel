# Change: Add Lighting System

## Why
A lighting system is crucial for visual realism and gameplay atmosphere in the voxel world. It enables day/night cycles, ambient lighting, and dynamic shadows, significantly enhancing the game's visual quality and immersion.

## What Changes
- Implement lighting calculation system
- Add ambient and directional lighting
- Implement shadow mapping
- Add light propagation for blocks
- Implement day/night cycle
- Add lighting optimization techniques

## Impact
- Affected specs: rendering, voxel-world
- Affected code: New lighting system in src/rendering/
- This will significantly improve visual quality
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Enables more realistic and immersive environments
