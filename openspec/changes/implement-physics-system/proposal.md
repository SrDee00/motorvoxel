# Change: Implement Physics System

## Why
A physics system is essential for realistic movement, collisions, and interactions in the voxel world. It will enable proper character movement, block interactions, entity collisions, and realistic object behavior, significantly enhancing gameplay realism and mechanics.

## What Changes
- Implement physics world with collision detection
- Add rigid body physics for entities
- Implement character controller for players
- Add collision resolution system
- Implement raycasting for interactions
- Add physics optimization techniques

## Impact
- Affected specs: physics, entity-system, voxel-world
- Affected code: New physics system in src/physics/
- This will significantly improve gameplay realism
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Enables realistic movement and interactions
